            <h2>Music Style and Artistry</h2>
            <p>
                aespa's music style stands out among 4th generation girl groups, mainly blending EDM, Hip-Hop, R&B, and
                other genres. The arrangements emphasize strong electronic bass and percussion instruments, paired with
                the different vocal qualities of the four members. The media has coined the term "metallic" (ÈêµÂë≥) to
                describe their sound, which has become the main and profound impression of aespa's music
                style[106][107]. Songs like "Next Level," "Savage," and "Drama" are representative of the group's
                "metallic" style.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the first studio album was released, member WINTER likened the song "Supernova" to a "canned" (Íπ°ÌÜµ)
                flavor, describing another lead single "Armageddon" as having a "earthy" (ÂúüÂë≥) flavor (Ìùô). [108] WINTER
                said, "Many people talk about aespa's songs having a 'metallic' (ÈêµÂë≥) flavor, but this album also has a
                variety of music genres like upbeat dance tracks and pop songs, in addition to the metallic taste."
